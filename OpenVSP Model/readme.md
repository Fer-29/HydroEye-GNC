# OpenVSP Model
This is where the VSP model of HydroEye is, and what is mainly used for aerodynamic data and stability coefficients. The other physical parameters usch as CG and I matrix were obtained through SolidWorks, additionally, the VSP's results were cross checked with a model done in XFLR5.
