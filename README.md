# HydroEye's Repository
## What is HydroEye
HydroEye is an agriculture based surveillance UAV, which features a hybrid power system of a PEM fuel cell and LiPo batteries to extend its endurance.
## Purpose
This repository has all of HydroEye's 6 DOF models, parameters and data which were used during its development. The main objective of the models is to accurately simulate HydroEye's flight dynamics, and its behaivour with the Pixhawk 6x Flight Controller, in addition to tuning its parameters through simulations.
