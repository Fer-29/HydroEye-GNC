# SITL Model
This is the Software In The Loop (SITL) model of HydroEye, it can be run locally or between different machines, the model needs some networking setup.
In case of windows a Windows Subsystem for Linux is required, for more information please refer to ArduPilot's SITL docs.

The model is currently being actively maintained.
